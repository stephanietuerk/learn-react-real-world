# Stephanie's React Learning App

For over six years, I've been working with Angular professionally. It's time to dive into some React. 

This is a copy of the (Real World)[https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld] example app that I'm building to learn React. I'm building it with Copilot turned off, so that I actually learn :).

Instead of using the Real World repo, I built this from scratch, scaffolding the app using the (Vite React + TypeScript template)[https://vite.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project]. I'm also making a few UX and design improvements to the original app along the way.
