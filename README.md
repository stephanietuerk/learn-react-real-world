# Stephanie's React Learning App

For over six years, I've been working with Angular professionally. It's quite obvious that it would be beneficial for me to know some React as well.

This is a copy of the (Real World)[https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld] example app that I'm building to learn React. I'm building it with Copilot turned off, so that I actually learn :).

Instead of using the Real World repo, I built from scratch, scaffolding the app using the (Vite React + TypeScript template)[https://vite.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project].
